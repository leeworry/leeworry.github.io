 I am now a Ph.D. candidate at the [School of Computer Science, Wuhan University](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/), supervised by Professor [Tieyun Qian](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/teacherinfo.aspx?id=209).  I expect to complete my Ph.D. study in 06/2023.
 
 My current research interests include information extraction, low-resource relation extraction, and few-shot learning. I am a member of ACM and IEEE.

 I received the BS degree in information management and information system from[Guangdong Medical University](https://www.gdmu.edu.cn/), China in 2016 and the MS degree in circuits and systems from [South China Normal University](https://www.scnu.edu.cn/), China supervised by Professor [Yun Xue](https://physics.scnu.edu.cn/a/20201219/6975.html) in 2019.
