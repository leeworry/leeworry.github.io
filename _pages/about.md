I am currently employed as a lecturer at Huazhong Agricultural University.
 
My present research focuses on information extraction, low-resource relation extraction, and few-shot learning. I am a member of ACM and IEEE.

I obtained my Ph.D. in engineering from the [School of Computer Science, Wuhan University](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/) under the guidance of Professor [Tieyun Qian](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/teacherinfo.aspx?id=209). Prior to that, I received my master's degree in circuits and systems from [South China Normal University](https://www.scnu.edu.cn/), supervised by Professor [Yun Xue](https://physics.scnu.edu.cn/a/20201219/6975.html) in 2019. During this period, I was awarded a scholarship by the school due to my outstanding performance, which enabled me to visit and study at the [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/) in Canada under the guidance of Professor [Jianyun Nie](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/nie-site/jian-yun-nie-en/).
In 2016, I completed my BS degree in information management and information system from [Guangdong Medical University](https://www.gdmu.edu.cn/).
