 I am now a Ph.D. candidate at the [School of Computer Science, Wuhan University](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/), supervised by Professor [Tieyun Qian](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/teacherinfo.aspx?id=209). 
 
 My current research interests include information extraction, low-resource relation extraction, and few-shot learning. 

 I received my B.S. and M.Eng degrees at the [Guangdong Medical University](https://www.gdmu.edu.cn/) and [South China Normal University](https://www.scnu.edu.cn/) respectively in 2016 and 2019, supervised by Professor [Yun Xue](https://physics.scnu.edu.cn/a/20201219/6975.html). 

 I expect to complete my Ph.D. study in 06/2023.
